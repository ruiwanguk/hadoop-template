hadoop-template
===============

The goal of this project is to provide a clean template for designing and chaining Hadoop jobs, where developers can
easily adapt for their project needs.

The template tries to answer a common set of questions:

1. How to implement a Hadoop job?
2. How to run a Hadoop job in local mode, pseudo-distributed mode and distributed-mode.
3. How to load custom properties from property files?
4. How to include third-party dependencies?
5. How to connect different jobs together?

###Prerequisite
This project is structured as a standard Java project. It uses Maven for it build, and it assumes that you are running on
\*nix platforms (Linux, Unix or Mac OS) in order to provide a set of useful shell scripts for launching Hadoop jobs.
